mach::cpu:
	changed from using a std::mutex to using a boost::condition_variable to notify of newly enqueued instructions
	set a boost::condition_variable notfication from within cpu::enqueue()
	externally separated 'load_file' in a loader (mach::cpu::loader)
	apparently fixed shutdown sequence to gracefully quit without errors
mach::dev
	deal with situation when peer does not respond when waiting for message in dev::receive_local()
mach::store:
	fixed: mach::store was joining group "queue::*" instead of "store::*"
Separated store, queue, and cpu into individual executables for the main test
