A clusterd ELF emulator.

It is a set of user space programs.
It loads ELF executable files in distributed RAM, and runs them in the cluster.

At this very early development stage, it is capable of running only very simple
statically-linked single-threaded CLI GNU/Linux ELF x86 executable files,
which require only the instructions 'noop', 'mov', and 'int 0x80', and which
do not use any other system calls.
